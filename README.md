# üõí Shop Service: Ecommerce Microservices üõçÔ∏è

This project implements a microservice architecture for an e-commerce system. It consists of several independent services, each responsible for specific aspects of the system such as product management, order processing, user authentication, payment handling, and notifications.


## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- Implement a scalable and maintainable e-commerce system using microservices architecture.
- Utilize various technologies and concepts such as Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Docker, Docker Compose, Kafka, Prometheus, and more.
- Ensure security using Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
- Facilitate CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins Pipeline for automated build, test, and deployment.
- Provide thorough documentation and instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Microservices

1. **Product Service**: Manages products and their details.
    - **REST API**:
        - GET /products: Get all products
        - GET /products/{id}: Get product by ID
        - POST /products: Create a new product
        - PUT /products/{id}: Update an existing product
        - DELETE /products/{id}: Delete a product

2. **Order Service**: Handles order management and processing.
    - **REST API**:
        - GET /orders: Get all orders
        - GET /orders/{id}: Get order by ID
        - POST /orders: Create a new order
        - PUT /orders/{id}: Update an existing order
        - DELETE /orders/{id}: Delete an order

3. **User Service**: Responsible for user authentication and authorization.
    - **REST API**:
        - GET /users: Get all users
        - GET /users/{id}: Get user by ID
        - POST /users: Create a new user
        - PUT /users/{id}: Update an existing user
        - DELETE /users/{id}: Delete a user

4. **Payment Service**: Deals with payment processing.
    - **REST API**:
        - POST /payments: Process a payment for an order

5. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users.

## Shared Libraries

1. **Common Library**: Contains shared code, models, and utilities used across multiple services.
2. **Security Library**: Contains security-related functionality such as authentication and authorization.

## Technologies and Concepts Used

- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud (Gateway API, Load Balancing, Cache, Health, Metrics)
- Spring Security
- Maven
- Docker, Dockerfile, Docker Compose
- Flyway Migration, JPA, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- OpenAPI (Swagger), HATEOAS Rest
- Apache Kafka, Email, Prometheus, Grafana, Testcontainers (Unit Test, Functional Test, Integration Test with Mockito)
- CI/CD with Jenkins Pipeline
- Dev Configuration and Production Environment Setup

## Entity Model

The entity model includes entities such as:
- Product
- Order
- User
- Payment
- Notification

Each microservice manages its related entities and exposes APIs for CRUD operations and business-specific functionality.

## Setup and Configuration

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run `docker-compose up` to build and start the microservices and their dependencies.
5. Access the individual microservices' endpoints as per their documentation for further configuration and usage.
